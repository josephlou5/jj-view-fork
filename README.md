# JJ View

**JJ View** brings the power of [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) version control directly into VS Code. Visualize your revision graph, manage changes, and streamline your workflow without leaving the editor.

## Features

### 🌲 Interactive Revision Graph

Visualize your `jj` repo history with a clear, interactive graph.

- **View History**: See commits, branches, and the working copy in a topological view.
- **Inspect Changes**: Click on any node to view details and diffs.
- **Context Actions**: Right-click nodes to perform actions like editing, squashing, or abandoning changes.
- **Drag & Drop Workflows**:
    - **Rebase Source**: Drag a commit onto another to rebase it (and its children) onto the target.
    - **Rebase Revision**: Hold `Ctrl` (or `⌘` on macOS) while dragging to rebase only the specific revision.
    - **Move Bookmarks**: Drag bookmark pills from one commit to another to move them.
- **Selection**:
    - **Multi-Select**: `Ctrl+Click` (or `⌘+Click`) to select multiple commits.
    - **Contextual Commands**: Perform bulk actions like "Abandon" on all selected commits.
    - **Clear**: Press `Escape` to clear the selection.

### 📝 Commit Details Panel

A dedicated view for inspecting and managing commits.

- **Edit Descriptions**: Easily update commit messages.
- **Diff Management**:
    - **Open Multi-File Diff**: View all changes in the revision in a single scrollable editor.
    - **Single-File Diff**: Click any file to open a side-by-side diff.
    - **Editable Diffs**: For mutable commits, diff editors are fully editable. Save changes (`Ctrl+S`) to apply them back to the commit.
- **Navigation**: Quickly jump between changed files.

### 🛠️ Source Control Integration

Full integration with VS Code's Source Control view (SCM).

- **Working Copy**: View modified files, stage changes (via `jj` commit/squash workflows), and restore files.
- **Commit Management**: Create new changes, set descriptions, and squash changes directly from the SCM panel.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Identify and resolve conflicts using VS Code's merge editor.
- **File Decorations**: Automatically highlights modified, added, and conflicted files in the Explorer with color-coded badges.

### 🚀 Efficient Workflows

Support for common and advanced `jj` operations:

- **Navigation**: Move to parent or child revisions easily.
- **Undo**: Quickly undo `jj` operations.
- **Squashing**: Squash changes into the parent revision.
- **Absorbing**: Automatically move changes into the mutable ancestor where they were introduced.
- **Rebasing**: Rebase changes onto other revisions.
- **Editable Diffs**: Edit any mutable commit directly in the diff editor. Changes are batched and applied on save, with full support for single and multi-file diffs.

### 🔄 Automatic Refresh

The extension automatically refreshes the view when:

| `jj-view.refreshDebounceMillis`        | `100`       | Base debounce time (ms) for SCM refresh based on file events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `jj-view.refreshDebounceMaxMultiplier` | `4`         | Maximum multiplier for the debounce timeout when events continue to occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `jj-view.fileWatcherMode`              | `"polling"` | Controls how the extension detects external file changes. `"polling"` uses periodic status checks. `"watch"` uses a native file watcher ([parcel-watcher](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher)) for more efficient, event-driven updates. Falls back to polling if the watcher fails to start. |
| `jj-view.gerrit.host`                  | `null`      | Gerrit host URL (e.g., https://experiment-review.googlesource.com). If not set, extension attempts to detect it from .gitreview or git remotes.                                                                                                                                                      |

| `jj-view.minChangeIdLength`            | `1`         | Minimum number of characters to display for change IDs.

| `jj-view.logTheme`                     | `"default"` | Color theme for the graph lanes in the JJ Log view. Available options: `default`, `oceanic`, `sunset`, `neon`, `pastel`, `monochrome`.                                                                                                                                                               |

## Advanced Configuration

### Conditional `jj` configuration

When `jj-view` executes `jj` commands, it sets the `JJ_VIEW_EXTENSION=1` environment variable. This allows you to configure conditional logic in your `.jjconfig.toml` file to apply specific settings only when interacting with the repository via the VS Code extension.

For example, you can configure a different default log revset for the extension:

```toml
[[--scope]]
--when.environments = ["JJ_VIEW_EXTENSION=1"]
[--scope.revsets]
log = "trunk().." # Or any other revset you prefer for the graph view
```

## File Watcher Mode

The `"watch"` mode uses [parcel-watcher](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher) for native, event-driven file change detection instead of periodic polling. This is more efficient for large repos, but may require additional setup depending on your platform.

**Linux — Increasing inotify watch limits**

The default `inotify` backend on Linux is limited by the system's max watch count. If you hit the limit, increase it:

```bash
# Check the current limit
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

# Increase temporarily (resets on reboot)
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

# Increase permanently
echo 'fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

**Linux & Windows — Using Watchman (recommended)**

On non-macOS platforms, we recommend installing [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) for a more robust and scalable file watching backend. When Watchman is installed and available on your `PATH`, parcel-watcher will automatically use it instead of `inotify` (Linux) or the default Windows backend. Watchman handles large repositories more gracefully and avoids inotify watch limit issues entirely.

## Requirements

- **Jujutsu (jj)**: The `jj` CLI must be installed and available in your system `PATH`.
